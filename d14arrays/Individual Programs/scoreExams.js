 /*
Write a function, scoreExams, that takes an array of arrays of student answers and 
an array of the correct answers. It should compare each studentâ€™s answers against 
the correct answers and return an array holding the scores of each student. 
The score for each student is a count of the number of correct answers (i.e., matches with
the key of correct answers). 

For example, 
const studentAnswers = [ [1, 1, 2, 4], [2, 1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 3, 4] ]; 
const correctAnswers =   [3, 1, 2, 4]; 
scoreExams(studentAnswers, correctAnswers)); --> [3,2,3]

const studentAnswers = [
    [1, 1, 2, 4],
    [2, 1, 2, 2],
    [3, 1, 3, 4]
];




const correctAnswers = [3, 1, 2, 4];



function scoreExams(studentAnswers, correctAnswers) {
    let examScores = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < studentAnswers.length; i++) {
        let sum = 0;

        for (let j = 0; j < studentAnswers[i].length; j++) {
            if (studentAnswers[i][j] === correctAnswers[j]) {
                sum = sum + 1;
            }
            examScores[i] = sum
        }
    }
    return examScores;
}
console.log(scoreExams(studentAnswers, correctAnswers));
